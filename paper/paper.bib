  abstract     = {Topological data analysis (TDA) is a collection of powerful tools that can quantify shape and structure in data in order to answer questions from the data's domain. This is done by representing some aspect of the structure of the data in a simplified topological signature. In this article, we introduce two of the most commonly used topological signatures. First, the persistence diagram represents loops and holes in the space by considering connectivity of the data points for a continuum of values rather than a single fixed value. The second topological signature, the mapper graph, returns a 1-dimensional structure representing the shape of the data, and is particularly good for exploration and visualization of the data. While these techniques are based on very sophisticated mathematics, the current ubiquity of available software means that these tools are more accessible than ever to be applied to data by researchers in education and learning, as well as all domain scientists.},

The idea is to encode an embedded shape using sub-level sets of a a function defined based on a given direction, and then returning the Euler characteristics of these sublevel sets. Because the ECT has been shown to be injective on the space of embedded simplicial complexes, it has been used for applications spanning a range of disciplines, including plant morphology and protein structural analysis. In this survey article, we present a comprehensive overview of the Euler characteristic transform, highlighting the main idea on a simple leaf example, and surveying its its key concepts, theoretical foundations, and available applications.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we provide the foundations for deriving the distributional properties of the smooth Euler characteristic transform. Motivated by functional data analysis, we propose two algorithms for testing hypotheses on random shapes based on these foundations. Simulation studies are provided to support our mathematical derivations and show the performance of our hypothesis testing framework. We apply our proposed algorithms to analyze a data set of mandibular molars from four genera of primates to test for shape differences and interpret the corresponding results from the morphology viewpoint. Our discussions connect the following fields: algebraic and computational topology, probability theory and stochastic processes, Sobolev spaces and functional analysis, statistical inference, morphology, and medical imaging.},

Using the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT), a geometrical-topological invariant, as a running example, I present different use cases that result in more efficient models for analyzing point clouds, graphs, and meshes. Moreover, I outline a vision for how topological concepts could be used in the future, comprising (1) the learning of functions on topological spaces, (2) the building of hybrid models that imbue neural networks with knowledge about the topological information in data, and (3) the analysis of qualitative properties of neural networks. With current research already addressing some of these aspects, this article thus serves as an introduction and invitation to this nascent area of research.},
