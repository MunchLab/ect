  abstract      = {The striking fractal geometry of strange attractors underscores the generative nature of chaos: like probability distributions, chaotic systems can be repeatedly measured to produce arbitrarily-detailed information about the underlying attractor. Chaotic systems thus pose a unique challenge to modern statistical learning techniques, while retaining quantifiable mathematical properties that make them controllable and interpretable as benchmarks. Here, we present a growing database currently comprising 131 known chaotic dynamical systems spanning fields such as astrophysics, climatology, and biochemistry. Each system is paired with precomputed multivariate and univariate time series. Our dataset has comparable scale to existing static time series databases; however, our systems can be re-integrated to produce additional datasets of arbitrary length and granularity. Our dataset is annotated with known mathematical properties of each system, and we perform feature analysis to broadly categorize the diverse dynamics present across the collection. Chaotic systems inherently challenge forecasting models, and across extensive benchmarks we correlate forecasting performance with the degree of chaos present. We also exploit the unique generative properties of our dataset in several proof-of-concept experiments: surrogate transfer learning to improve time series classification, importance sampling to accelerate model training, and benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms.},

Persistent topological Laplacians (PTLs) overcome some limitations of persistent homology, a key technique in TDA, and provide substantial insight to the behavior of various geometric and topological objects. This work extends PTLs to directed flag complexes, which are an exciting generalization to flag complexes, also known as clique complexes, that arise naturally in many situations. We introduce the directed flag Laplacian and show that the proposed persistent directed flag Laplacian (PDFL) is a distinct way of analyzing these flag complexes. Example calculations are provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed PDFL in real world applications.},

  abstract = {We establish a strong connection between Topological Data Analysis (TDA)and the field of time-series classification. This is accomplished via two novel contributions. The first is a method for extracting topological information from a timeseries in a manner which circumvents the expensive computation normally required. The second is an adaption of an existing topological summary to create an efficient topological time-series pooling operator. Taken together, these insights enable anew classifier, TopRocket (Topological Random Convolutional Kernel Transform).Using standard comparison methods, TopRocket ranks second among all univariate time-series classifiers. Further, TopRocket is the best performing scalable classifier. As a final contribution, we provide the fastest available implementation of the algorithm for computing time-series sublevel set persistence. This provides a foundation for further investigation of TDA for time-series classification.This work lies at the intersection of TDA and machine learning, where success is dependent on efficiently extracting topological information from data and using that information with downstream models. For this purpose, we develop an efficient, data-based, topological summary, the Betti pooling operator. We rigorously demonstrate the utility of TopRocket by evaluating its performance against the University of California Riverside (UCR) Time Series Archive, a widely used benchmark collection of data sets. TopRocket is the first TDA-based classifier to obtain state-of-the art results on any similarly competitive problem. We strongly believe that TDA will play a central role in the future of machine learning.},

  abstract = {Topological data analysis (TDA) is field that started only two decades ago and has already shown promise both in theory and in applications. The goal of TDA is to quantify the shape of data in a manner that is concise and robust using concepts from algebraic topology. Persistent homology, arguably the most popular tool from TDA, studies the shape of a filtered space by watching how its homology changes. The output of persistent homology is a persistence diagram, which encodes information about the changing homology. Persistent homology has shown success in various application areas; one ever growing area of study in this field is time series analysis. Nonlinear time series analysis is a research field in and of itself that aims to capture structure in time series data, however, it lacks theoretically justified tools to analyze the resulting structure. Persistent homology comes with a solid theoretical framework, is robust to noise, and quantifies the same type of structure as appears in time series data. Thus combining tools from time series analysis and TDA provides a new approach to analyze and quantify behavior in time series data. One field where time series are prevalent is dynamical systems, since a time series arises from a projection of a solution to a system. Specifically, given a time series, Takens' theorem can be leveraged to embed the time series as a point cloud in a higher dimensional space, where this point cloud is a sampling of the full state space. Then for each time series, persistent homology can be computed on the embedding. The result is a persistence diagram for each time series. The question then becomes how do we analyze this collection of persistence diagrams to learn something about the original time series data? Many people have developed methods to answer this question, through methods such as machine learning or statistics. This dissertation provides several new methods leveraging tools from both TDA and nonlinear time series analysis to study time varying data.},

  abstract      = {Persistence diagrams are common descriptors of the topological structure of data appearing in various classification and regression tasks. They can be generalized to Radon measures supported on the birth-death plane and endowed with an optimal transport distance. Examples of such measures are expectations of probability distributions on the space of persistence diagrams. In this paper, we develop methods for approximating continuous functions on the space of Radon measures supported on the birth-death plane, as well as their utilization in supervised learning tasks. Indeed, we show that any continuous function defined on a compact subset of the space of such measures (e.g., a classifier or regressor) can be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomial combinations of features computed using a continuous compactly supported function on the birth-death plane (a template). We provide insights into the structure of relatively compact subsets of the space of Radon measures, and test our approximation methodology on various data sets and supervised learning tasks.},

In particular, it includes implementations of functions that, given some data, provide topological information about the underlying space, such as the distance function, the distance to a measure, the kNN density estimator, the kernel density estimator, and the kernel distance. The salient topological features of the sublevel sets (or superlevel sets) of these functions can be quantified with persistent homology. We provide an R interface for the efficient algorithms of the C++ libraries GUDHI, Dionysus and PHAT, including a function for the persistent homology of the Rips filtration, and one for the persistent homology of sublevel sets (or superlevel sets) of arbitrary functions evaluated over a grid of points. The significance of the features in the resulting persistence diagrams can be analyzed with functions that implement recently developed statistical methods. The R package TDA also includes the implementation of an algorithm for density clustering, which allows us to identify the spatial organization of the probability mass associated to a density function and visualize it by means of a dendrogram, the cluster tree.},

  abstract       = {Topological data analysis (TDA) is a collection of powerful tools that can quantify shape and structure in data in order to answer questions from the data's domain. This is done by representing some aspect of the structure of the data in a simplified topological signature. In this article, we introduce two of the most commonly used topological signatures. First, the persistence diagram represents loops and holes in the space by considering connectivity of the data points for a continuum of values rather than a single fixed value. The second topological signature, the mapper graph, returns a 1-dimensional structure representing the shape of the data, and is particularly good for exploration and visualization of the data. While these techniques are based on very sophisticated mathematics, the current ubiquity of available software means that these tools are more accessible than ever to be applied to data by researchers in education and learning, as well as all domain scientists.},

  abstract = {Topological data analysis (TDA) is a powerful tool to solve classification problems using the underlying shape of data. Furthermore, TDA is useful in shape reconstruction of compact manifolds embedded in two and three dimensional Euclidean space. Unfortunately, these reconstructions can be computationally taxing. Many in the field are searching for solutions which are more computationally efficient and theoretical guarantees for the minimal amount of information for reconstructions within a given tolerance of error.Our approach is to study TDA on voxel data to offer both a computationally and memory efficient solution in practice. Assuming a lattice structure for our cubical geometric realization we are able to prove a sharp upper bound for all dimensions of 2d for the number of persistence diagrams generated from sublevel set filtrations required to reconstruct grayscale digital images. By improving topological reconstructions, the authors believe that TDA may become a pragmatic tool to apply to computerized tomography images for both storage and potentially classification for automated diagnosis of particular diseases such as melanoma.},

  title    = {Searching and Reconstruction: Algorithms with Topological Descriptors},
  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {Topological data analysis and, more specifically, persistent homology have received significant attention as a method of describing the shape of complex data. Persistent homology measures the persistence (i.e., "relative size'') of topological features such as connected components, holes, voids, etc. as a space is filtered. The persistence is often plotted in what is referred to as a persistence diagram. Persistence diagrams encode both topological and geometric information about shapes. Moreover, certain parameterized sets of persistence diagrams are sufficient for representing particular classes of shapes. In other words, a set of persistence diagrams can be substituted for the shape. Shape representation using persistence diagrams has shown promise in several learning and classification tasks on shape data. However, choosing a sufficient parameterized set of persistence diagrams is challenging. Previous solutions utilize exhaustive sampling approaches based on assumptions on the geometry of the shape and algebraic results. We consider the inverse problem of "reconstructing'' the shape, using (augmented) persistence diagrams. Developing algorithms for reconstruction provides an alternative method of finding descriptors for representation that is optimized to minimize the number of diagrams and time complexity. In this work, we provide deterministic algorithms for reconstructing simplicial complexes in R^d and discuss challenges in reconstruction using other topological descriptors.Shape reconstruction, and several other areas of research utilizing the persistence diagram, are predisposed to generating large numbers of diagrams. As such, developing efficient methods for searching in the space of persistence diagrams is also of great importance. We consider the bottleneck distance in the space of persistence diagrams. The bottleneck distance is used often in practice for comparing one diagram to another. However, the cost of computing the bottleneck distance can grow prohibitive for large sets of diagrams using a brute-force approach. We offer a data structure and algorithm for identifying the approximate nearest neighbor (and approximate k-nearest neighbors) in the space of persistence diagrams in less time than the brute-force approach for large sets of diagrams.},

  abstract  = {The persistence diagram (PD) is an increasingly popular topological descriptor. By encoding the size and prominence of topological features at varying scales, the PD provides important geometric and topological information about a space. Recent work has shown that well-chosen (finite) sets of PDs can differentiate between geometric simplicial complexes, providing a method for representing complex shapes using a finite set of descriptors. A related inverse problem is the following: given a set of PDs (or an oracle we can query for persistence diagrams), what is underlying geometric simplicial complex? In this paper, we present an algorithm for reconstructing embedded graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (plane graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$) with $n$ vertices from $n^2 - n + d + 1$ directional (augmented) PDs. Additionally, we empirically validate the correctness and time-complexity of our algorithm in $\mathbb{R}^2$ on randomly generated plane graphs using our implementation, and explain the numerical limitations of implementing our algorithm.},

  abstract      = {Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a relatively new field of data analysis, has proved very useful in a variety of applications. The main persistence tool from TDA is persistent homology in which data structure is examined at many scales. Representations of persistent homology include persistence barcodes and persistence diagrams, both of which are not straightforward to reconcile with traditional machine learning algorithms as they are sets of intervals or multisets. The problem of faithfully representing barcodes and persistent diagrams has been pursued along two main avenues: kernel methods and vectorizations. One vectorization is the Betti sequence, or Betti curve, derived from the persistence barcode. While the Betti sequence has been used in classification problems in various applications, to our knowledge, the stability of the sequence has never before been discussed. In this paper we show that the Betti sequence is unstable under the 1-Wasserstein metric with regards to small perturbations in the barcode from which it is calculated. In addition, we propose a novel stabilized version of the Betti sequence based on the Gaussian smoothing seen in the Stable Persistence Bag of Words for persistent homology. We then introduce the normalized cumulative Betti sequence and provide numerical examples that support the main statement of the paper.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we consider two topological transforms based on Euler calculus: the persistent homology transform (PHT) and the Euler characteristic transform (ECT). Both of these transforms are of interest for their mathematical properties as well as their applications to science and engineering, because they provide a way of summarizing shapes in a topological, yet quantitative, way. Both transforms take a shape, viewed as a tame subset M of R^d, and associates to each direction v in S^{d-1} a shape summary obtained by scanning M in the direction v. These shape summaries are either persistence diagrams or piecewise constant integer valued functions called Euler curves. By using an inversion theorem of Schapira, we show that both transforms are injective on the space of shapes---each shape has a unique transform. By making use of a stratified space structure on the sphere, induced by hyperplane divisions, we prove additional uniqueness results in terms of distributions on the space of Euler curves. Finally, our main result provides the first (to our knowledge) finite bound required to specify any shape in certain uncountable families of shapes, bounded below by curvature. This result is perhaps best appreciated in terms of shattering number or the perspective that any point in these particular moduli spaces of shapes is indexed using a tree of finite depth.},

We can define a distance between two shapes by integrating over the sphere the distance between their respective extended persistence modules. By using extended persistence we get finite distances between shapes even when they have different Betti numbers. We use Morse theory to show that the extended persistence of a height function over a manifold with boundary can be deduced from the extended persistence for that height function restricted to the boundary, alongside labels on the critical points as positive or negative critical. We study the application of the XPHT to binary images; outlining an algorithm for efficient calculation of the XPHT exploiting relationships between the PHT of the boundary curves to the extended persistence of the foreground.},

In this paper we study the concept of Euler Characteristics Curves, for one parameter filtrations and Euler Characteristic Profiles, for multi-parameter filtrations. While being a weaker invariant in one dimension, we show that Euler Characteristic based approaches do not possess some handicaps of persistent homology; we show efficient algorithms to compute them in a distributed way, their generalization to multifiltrations and practical applicability for big data problems. In addition we show that the Euler Curves and Profiles enjoys certain type of stability which makes them robust tool in data analysis.

  abstract      = {Persistent homology is perhaps the most popular and useful tool offered by topological data analysis, with point-cloud data being the most common setup. Its older cousin, the Euler characteristic curve (ECC) is less expressive, but far easier to compute. It is particularly suitable for analyzing imaging data, and is commonly used in fields ranging from astrophysics to biomedical image analysis. These fields are embracing GPU computations to handle increasingly large datasets. We therefore propose an optimized GPU implementation of ECC computation for 2D and 3D grayscale images. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we offer a practical tool, illustrating its performance with thorough experimentation, but also explain its inherent shortcomings. Second, this simple algorithm serves as a perfect backdrop for highlighting basic GPU programming techniques that make our implementation so efficient, and some common pitfalls we avoided. This is intended as a step towards a wider usage of GPU programming in computational geometry and topology software. We find this is particularly important as geometric and topological tools are used in conjunction with modern, GPU-accelerated machine learning frameworks.},

However, small perturbations of a shape can lead to large distortions in its ECT. In this paper, we propose a new metric on compact one-dimensional shapes and prove that the ECT is stable with respect to this metric. Crucially, our result uses curvature, rather than the size of a triangulation of an underlying shape, to control stability. We further construct a computationally tractable statistical estimator of the ECT based on the theory of Gaussian processes. We use our stability result to prove that our estimator is consistent on shapes perturbed by independent ambient noise; i.e., the estimator converges to the true ECT as the sample size increases.},

We demonstrate our method on a data set of segmented videos of mouse small intestine organoid experiments and show that it outperforms classical shape descriptors.

  abstract      = {Persistent homology is a tool that can be employed to summarize the shape of data by quantifying homological features. When the data is an object in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the (augmented) persistent homology transform ((A)PHT) is a family of persistence diagrams, parameterized by directions in the ambient space. A recent advance in understanding the PHT used the framework of reconstruction in order to find finite a set of directions to faithfully represent the shape, a result that is of both theoretical and practical interest. In this paper, we improve upon this result and present an improved algorithm for graph -- and, more generally one-skeleton -- reconstruction. The improvement comes in reconstructing the edges, where we use a radial binary (multi-)search. The binary search employed takes advantage of the fact that the edges can be ordered radially with respect to a reference plane, a feature unique to graphs.},

  abstract      = {The computer vision task of reconstructing 3D images, i.e., shapes, from their single 2D image slices is extremely challenging, more so in the regime of limited data. Deep learning models typically optimize geometric loss functions, which may lead to poor reconstructions as they ignore the structural properties of the shape. To tackle this, we propose a novel topological loss function based on the Euler Characteristic Transform. This loss can be used as an inductive bias to aid the optimization of any neural network toward better reconstructions in the regime of limited data. We show the effectiveness of the proposed loss function by incorporating it into SHAPR, a state-of-the-art shape reconstruction model, and test it on two benchmark datasets, viz., Red Blood Cells and Nuclei datasets. We also show a favourable property, namely injectivity and discuss the stability of the topological loss function based on the Euler Characteristic Transform.},

  abstract      = {Topological transforms have been very useful in statistical analysis of shapes or surfaces without restrictions that the shapes are diffeomorphic and requiring the estimation of correspondence maps. In this paper we introduce two topological transforms that generalize from shapes to fields, $f:\mathbf{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$. Both transforms take a field and associate to each direction $v\in S^{d-1}$ a summary obtained by scanning the field in the direction $v$. The transforms we introduce are of interest for both applications as well as their theoretical properties. The topological transforms for shapes are based on an Euler calculus on sets. A key insight in this paper is that via a lifting argument one can develop an Euler calculus on real valued functions from the standard Euler calculus on sets, this idea is at the heart of the two transforms we introduce. We prove the transforms are injective maps. We show for particular moduli spaces of functions we can upper bound the number of directions needed determine any particular function.},
